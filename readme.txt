Dear Editor:
	 
We are pleased to submit our manuscript "Local primordial non-Gaussianity from the large-scale clustering of photometric DESI luminous red galaxies" by Mehdi Rezaie, Ashley J. Ross, Hee-Jong Seo et al. for publication by Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. The manuscript presents our effort to constrain the local-type primordial non-Gaussianity using photometric galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument imaging. Our work utilizes state-of-the art methods to mitigate observational systematics and prepare the data for such a subtle measurement.

Enclosed, please find all files for this manuscript organized in two folders, namely figures and sections, respectively, for the visualizations and .tex files. The root directory contains higher level files including:
