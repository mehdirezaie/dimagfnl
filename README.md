Remaining steps:
1. Study how $f_{\rm NL}$ constraints change after applying various cuts based on imaging, pixel completeness, and including extra calibration and HI density maps.
2. Mock test in the presence of systematic effects: the goal will be to use a moderate contamination and apply a 'linear' and 'nonlinear' treatment to simulate under-correction and over-correction.
