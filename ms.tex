%%% TO DO
% Fig.5. add some statistics (skewness, kurtosis, etc) to test whether Gaussian. Add ideal N(mu, sigma) to the panels
%1. add a constant to C_ell (trial and error) to see if log(C_ell+cte) is perfectly Gaussian, zero skewness and kurtosis, etc, higher moments
% 3. 
%Mock test in the presence of systematics: (include applying the most rigorous method on both the mocks and data)
%Check the impact of n(z -> 0) on C_ell and fNL constraints
%Try the main selection of LRGs
%Increase the max ell for the cross power spectrum used in χ2
%Test theory code with non-zero fNL mocks
%Test covariance: DR9 fNL constraints using the fNL=100 covariance
%Use Hui’s weights
%Use Rongpu’s weights
%Check the impact of dropping lowest ell bin, or in general, how it change as a function of l_min
%Check the impact of applying a rigorous cut on pixel completeness.
% look into analytical covariance, e.g., Gaussian
% Mehdi,
%
%In the SV3 LRG selection, the TS density is ~800 deg^-2 (in the main selection, the LRG density is ~600 deg^-2). I think some additional cuts, by removing a few percents, we can improve the purity of the selection. It’s worth talking about that with Rongpu. As we have the spectro catalog, I think that it is clearly possible.
