%%% TO DO
% 1. add a constant to C_ell (trial and error) to see if log(C_ell+cte) is perfectly Gaussian, zero skewness and kurtosis, etc, higher moments
% 2. fit DR9 with fNL=100 covariance to ensure that changing the covariance would not influence the results
% 3. 
%Use Hui’s weights
%Use Rongpu’s weights
%Check the impact of dropping lowest ell bin, or in general, how it change as a function of l_min
%Check the impact of applying a rigorous cut on pixel completeness.
% look into analytical covariance, e.g., Gaussian
% Mehdi,
%
%In the SV3 LRG selection, the TS density is ~800 deg^-2 (in the main selection, the LRG density is ~600 deg^-2). I think some additional cuts, by removing a few percents, we can improve the purity of the selection. It’s worth talking about that with Rongpu. As we have the spectro catalog, I think that it is clearly possible.
