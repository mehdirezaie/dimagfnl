%%% TO DO
%For documentation purposes, here is the list of action items:
%Use log(C_ell) instead of C_ell
%if failed; we would use the fiducial covariance, and then adjust the covariance using the best fit.
%Use Hui’s weights
%Use Rongpu’s weights
%Check the impact of dropping lowest ell bin, or in general, how it change as a function of l_min
%Check the impact of applying a rigorous cut on pixel completeness.
% look into analytical covariance, e.g., Gaussian
% Mehdi,

%In the SV3 LRG selection, the TS density is ~800 deg^-2 (in the main selection, the LRG density is ~600 deg^-2). I think some additional cuts, by removing a few percents, we can improve the purity of the selection. It’s worth talking about that with Rongpu. As we have the spectro catalog, I think that it is clearly possible.
