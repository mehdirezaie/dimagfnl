%%% TO DO
% fit fnl=100 C_ell with cov from fnl=0 --> done
% include all depth maps + E[B-V] --> running
% make x-axis range the same in Fig 8 --> done
% add best fit C_ell to Fig. 9 --> done
% check errors scaling with fsky.. sigma ~ 1/sqrt(fsky)
% test with Hui's weights
% test with Rongpu's weights
% test with dropping lowest ell bin

% look into analytical covariance, e.g., Gaussian

%In the SV3 LRG selection, the TS density is ~800 deg^-2 (in the main selection, the LRG density is ~600 deg^-2). I think some additional cuts, by removing a few percents, we can improve the purity of the selection. Itâ€™s worth talking about that with Rongpu. As we have the spectro catalog, I think that it is clearly possible.
